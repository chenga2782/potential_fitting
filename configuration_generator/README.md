# Normal Mode Configuration Generator

Automated script to generate the optimized geometry, normal modes, and a set of normal distribution configurations based on the molecular normal modes starting from a reference geometry.

## Usage:
`python nmcgen.py [config.ini]`
The driver script can be run from the command line with a single positional input being the `.ini` file that contains the configuration settings for the script.

**Configuration file format:**
```
[files]
input_geometry_path =   h2o.xyz     | the .xyz file containing the starting geometry

name =                  h2o         | the name used in the output files
# OPTIONAL: default value = the input_geometry_path filename up until the first underscore, not including .xyz

output_path =           outputs/    | the path to output all produced files
# OPTIONAL: default value = outputs/

optimize =              false       | wether or not to skip the optimization step. if true, the input geometry will be assumed to be optimized.
# OPTIONAL: default value = false

input_normal_modes = h2o_normal.dat | the path to the normal modes (in gcn format) to use for calculations. if provided, frequency calculation will be skipped
# OPTIONAL: default value = None (as in do the frequency calculation)

[molecule]
charge =                0           | the charge of the molecule
# OPTIONAL: default value = 0

multiplicity =          1           | the spin multiplicity of the molecule
# OPTIONAL: default value = 1

[config_generator]
random =                P           | whether a Q(uasirandom) or P(suedorandom) sequence is to be used
# OPTIONAL: default value = P

num_configs =           128         | the number of configurations to generate

geometric =             false       | whether or not a geometric progression is to be used for temperature T and A
# OPTIONAL: default value = false

linear =                true        | whether or not a linear progression is to be used for temperature T and A
# OPTIONAL: default value = true

[model]
method =                blyp        | the calculation model method to use
basis =	                cc-pvdz     | the calculation model basis to use

[program]
code =                  psi4        | which quantum chemistry code to use for the calculations
# OPTIONAL: default value = psi4

memory =                1GB         | the amount of memory to allocate to the selected code
# OPTIONAL: default value = 1GB

num_threads =           1           | the number of threads to run on for the selected code
# OPTIONAL: default value = 1 
```

## Outputs
All files are prefixed with `name_code_model_basis`.

`prefix_optimized.xyz` - Contains the optimized geometry following the geometry optimization (ready to be input into gcn)  
`prefix_normalmodes.dat` - Contains the normal modes following the frequency calculations (ready to be input into gcn)  
`prefix.inp` - The input for Sandra's gcn  
`prefix.out` - The log outputs from Sandra's gcn  
`prefix_configurations.xyz` - The normal mode configurations generated by Sandra's gcn
